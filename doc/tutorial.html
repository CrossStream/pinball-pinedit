      <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>
	This tutorial will learn you the basics of how to create pinball tables with 
	the editor. It is assumed that you have some basic knowledge
	of 3D modelling, you need at least to know what a vertex and a polygon
	is. You also have to, at least once in your life, written a hello-world
	c/c++ program and compiled it. Beware that the editor is at an alpha stage
	and that some things ain't that intiutive and others are purely clumsy.
	Remember to save often, the editor may crash (no surprise). 
	Know that that's said let's start.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>

      <h2><a name="creating a table">Creating a Table</a></h2>
      <p>
	First you have to create a working directory for your table. 
	Do this with the 'pinball-template' script, the script is found
	in the same director as the 'pinedit' program. Execute
	'pinball-template mytable MyMod' to create a directory 
	with the name 'mytable' and a module with the name MyMod.
	The script will copy a makefile, an empty table and a module to
	your directory.	Now you have a new fresh table which we will load into the editor.
	Press the 'open file' <img src="fileopen.xpm"></img> button, and choose the
	'mytable/pinball.pbl' file. Now a simple table pops up in the editor.
	Do no confuse the open button with the 'load object' button.
      </p>
      <p>
	Before we start adding objects let's see how you compile the table and load
	it in to the pinball game. Make sure that have autoconf 2.13 and 
	automake 1.4 installed. Older as well	as newer version of autoconf/automake 
	may break the compilation, read further if you have different version.
        First you have edit the file 'mytable/Makefile.am', change every instance 
	of 'template' with 'mytable'.	Go to your table directory and execute 
	'./bootstrap', this will set up the configure and make scripts. Then 
	configure the table with './configure	
	--with-pinball-prefix=<i>pinball_source_dir</i>' where <i>pinball_source_dir</i>
	points to the root directory of the pinball sources, in
	our case '../pinball'. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Now make the	table with 'make'. 
	If your version of autoconf/automake 
	doesn't like the scripts you can try to hack the 'Makefile.fix' file 
	and use 'make -f Makefile.fix' and skip the 'bootstrap/configure' thing.
	Run 'pinball -dir' to see your systems path to the pinball data
	directory. It should be something like'/usr/local/share/pinball' 
	or '/usr/share/pinball'. The directories 'tux' and 
	'professor' should reside in that directory.
	Then do a 'make install' ('make -f Makefile.fix install') as root user 
	to install the table.	If it fails you can try to manually copy the files to 
	the data directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	Start up the pinball game and you should
	now see 'mytable' alongside 'tux' and 'professor' in the table meny.
	Each directory that is found in the data directory is added to the loadable 
	tables in the game, the game will look for the 'pinball.pbl' file when trying 
	to load a table. It is not yet possible to test play the table from editor so 
	this is how you debug your tables. If you have compiled the game as a debug
	version (the game included with the editor package is debug as default,
	stand alone game package is not debug) you can steer the ball with
	'i' ,'j', 'k' and 'l' keys.				
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>
      
      <h3><a name="walls">Walls</a></h3>
      <p>
	Walls are created by adding polygons to the table. The easiest way is to select
	a corner of an existing wall and then extrude it. Pop up the editor again and
	open your table. Select the 'objects' tab in the right part of the
	editor. Open up the object called 'walls', you see that the object has
	two children, select 'shape 0'.
	Now the buttons for editing shapes will be enabled and 'shape 0' will be shown
	in the 2D panels. You can move around in the 2D views by dragging with the right
	mouse button. Clicking middle button centers the view. The zoom can be changed
	in the spinbox up to right.
      </p>
      <p>
	Enable the select button <img src="workselect.xpm"></img> and in the 2D view select 
	a corner in the top of the table by dragging the a square around the corner with the
	left mouse button.. Extrude it to an new wall by clicking the extrude 
	button <img src="workextrude.xpm"></img>. Select move <img src="workmove.xpm"></img>
	and move the new wall down. Extrude and move until you have created an open circle.
	Delete the unnecessary polygon by selecting it and clicking 
	<img src="workdeletepolygon.xpm"></img>.
	<img src="ss1.jpg"></img> <img src="ss2.jpg"></img>
	<img src="ss3.jpg"></img> <img src="ss4.jpg"></img><br></br>
	<img src="ss5.jpg"></img>
      </p>			
      <p>
	Then select the edges of the open wall and create a polygon by clicking the
	new polygon button <img src="worknewpolygon.xpm"></img>. Polygons does, unfortunately, 
	not	always come out right. Use the 3D view to look at your walls (rotation
	and moving in the 3D view is a bit inconvenient at the moment, it will
	be fixed later). If the vertex order of your polygons are wrong you can
	change it in the 'polygons' tab. Select your polygon and go to the 
	'polygons' tab in the right of the editor. Scroll down to the highlighted
	polygon and click on it. Now you can change to order of the vertices
	by selecing the vertex in the 'vertices of polygon' list and changing
	the order by moving it up or down in the 'order' tab below. If
	the polygon only faces in the wrong direction you can fix it
	by fliping it <img src="workflip.xpm"></img>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Your walls look quite naked without any roof, right? Add the roof
	to 'shape 1'. This is left as an exercise for the reader.  
	The reason to split the roofs and the walls is that we
	do not won't to check for collision between the roofs and the ball, only
	between the walls and the ball. Hence, collision detecion is only preformed
	on the first shape in the object, this way decortive shapes can be added
	without giving performance penalties to the collision detection.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="adding objects">Adding objects</a></h2>
      <p>
	There are a number of prebuilt objects in 'pinedit/data' directory that
	can be used in the tables. The load object button 
	<img src="workloadgroup.xpm"></img> inserts the object into the table.
	All loadable objects has filenames ending with '.pbl'.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>
      
      <h3><a name="bumpers">Bumpers</a></h3>
      <p>
	Load the object 'pinedit/data/bumper.pbl'. Go to the object tab and
	select the object called 'bumper'. Select the 'move object' button
	<img src="workmovegroup.xpm"></img> and move the bumper to the top right
	corner of the table by dragging it with the left muose button. Add two
	more bumpers and create a nice formation. 
      </p>
      <img src="ss6.jpg"></img>
      <p>
	You can add a sound that
	is played each time the ball hits the bumper by opening the object
	in the object tab and selecting the child called 'bumper behavior'.
	With the 'edit behavior' button below you can pop up a dialog
	to select a wav-file for your sound. Even if the editor allows
	you to pick files in any directory the file must be in the
	'mytable' directory. There are some sound files in the 'pinedit/data'
	directory that you can copy to your table directory. You also have
	to edit the 'Makefile.am' to add your sounds. E.g.
	<pre>
...
mytabledata_DATA = pinball.pbl mysounfile1.wav mysoundfile2.wav
...
	</pre>
	Otherwise the sounds won't be installed. If your using the 'Makefile.fix' file
	you have to manually copy the files into '/usr/local/share/pinball/mytable'.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>

      <h3><a name="arms">Arms</a></h3>
      <p>
	Arms can be found in the files 'left_arm.pbl' and 'right_arm.pbl'. You
	can add a sound also to the arms. But as the table already has two arms
	we don't add any more arms.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>
      
      <h3><a name="locks and caves">Locks and caves</a></h3>
      <p>
	You'll find two locks and a release button in the files 'lock1.pbl',
	'lock2.pbl' and 'releaselock.pbl'. Place them somehere on the left
	side of the table, you can create some fancy walls for them if you
	like. As you can see the locks have a shape consisting of one polygon. We
	need this polygon for collision detection (may change in upcoming
	versions). You may want to make the polygon invisible, you can do
	so by selecting the shape and enabling the 'hidden' checkbox below and
	pressing the apply button.
      </p>
      <p>
	The locks and releaselock objects are managed by statemachines. You
	can edit the statemachines for each object by selecting the
	'state behavior' object of the child and clicking 'edit behavior'.
	If you choose the 'lock1' object and pop up the statemachine
	you see that this object has two states. <!--There are a lot of
	properties associated with each state, see the manual to learn
	more about them.--> The first state will always be activated when the table 
	is reset, it can also be activated be receiving a signal from another
	object, this is called the 'asig'.
      </p>
      <p>
	The first state of 'lock1' will be actived either by reset or by receiving the 
	'multiball_off' signal.	The second state will be activated on the signal
	'releaselock'. When on object detects a collision with a ball it may
	emit a signal, this is 'csig'. Only the first state emits a signal
	called 'lock1'. This signal will be received by the second lock and
	thus activating it. The two states have diffrent type, the type is
	found under the type tab. The fist state is of the 'lock' type meaning that
	it will drag balls towards it when they collide. The second state
	has no type, meaning that any captured balls will be released when
	the second state is activated.
      </p>
      <a href="#top">top</a>

      <h3><a name="ramps">Ramps</a></h3>
      <p>
	Ramps are created the same way as walls. Create a formation in 'shape0'
	of object 'walls' as shown in the first	picture. 
	Select the open inner corners and drag them up in the air. Create a flat
	polygon on the floor and drag to front corners up in the air and the
	bottom corners down to the floor. Make a copy of the recent polygon and place 
	at about two and a half units above the original polygon,
	flip the polygon. We need this type of invisible polygon on top of the ramp otherwise
	the balls may bounce up in the air from the ramp and fly outside the table.
      </p>
      <p>
	The create a lane in the air for the ramps start by creating a new object
	<img src="worknewgroup.xpm"></img>, call it 'lane'. Create a new shape for lane
	<img src="worknewshape.xpm"></img>. Create a three connected polygons 
	and drag the outer corners up in the air and inwards to the create the first 
	lane segement. Extrude and move corners until you have created a nice lane.
	Do not forget to enable collision detection for your lane. Select the 
	object 'lane', and enable the 'collision', 'transform once' and 'wall' and 
	press 'apply'.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="writing scripts">Writing Scripts</a></h2>
      <p>
	You can write c++ scripts that controls a single object or the whole table.
	The scipts are compiled and loaded as plugins, our table uses one such script
	to control the table. The file 'ModuleScript.cpp' is compiled into
	to plugin/library 'libmodule_script.so' which is then loaded into the table by
	the game. In the editor the module is defined by the object called 'module'.
	This object has no shapes only one behavior which loads the plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
	Use the 'ModuleScript' as base for writing your srcipts. The four methods
	that will be called by the engine are 'onTick', 'StdOnCollision',
	'StdOnSignal' and 'StdOnSignal'. The 'onTick' function is
	called each time the game advanced one time step. The 'StdOnCollisin'
	is called if a ball collides with the object, you use this
	one only if you don't want to use the statemachine behavior and
	instead write a custom behavior for an object. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The 'StdOnSignal'	is called each time an object sends a signal to the engine. 
	The 'OnSignal' makro can be used to catch a signal. If the engine sends the
	signal 'PBL_SIG_RESET_ALL', the sript should reset all its internal variables
	to the inital state. You find the id for you own signals  
	by calling 'Loader::getInstance()->getSignal("my_signal_name")'. The signal
	names are the same that state behaviors are using. If the 'getSignal' don't
	find any id for the given signal it will assign a new id for the signal name.
      </p>
      <p>
	You can send signal to other object in the game with the 'SendSignal' makro.
	<pre>
SendSignal( signal_id,   // use Loader::getInstance()->getSignal("my_signal_name")
            delay,       // delay in time steps before the signal is sent, 0 meaning now
            sendar,      // usually this->getParent()
            receiver )   // NULL meaning everybody
	</pre>
	Look in the file 'pinball/base/StateMachine.h' if you want to see how these
	makros are defined.
      </p>

Ok, this is the first snapshot of the editor. It is a pre-alpha, seg-faulting,
doc-less wretch. But be patient it will get better. Remember that I warned you 
about the seg-faults.

So, you need to have the latest _cvs_ 'pinball' source directory in the same
directory as the 'pinedit' source directory.

I.e.
  home -> mydevdir -> pinball
                   -> pinedit

Then you need to change the EM_QTDIR variable in the 'configure.in' file
in the 'pinedit' directory to point to your qt-3.x.x  develop directory. Do 
a 'bootstrap', a 'configure' and a 'make'. I never do the 'make install', I just run 
the app from the source dir with 'pinedit/pinedit'. (If anyone wants to
fix the qt-thing in 'configure.in', be my guest.)

I recommend that you build the pinball sources as a debug version. The cvs version
is usually debug. Check that the 'configure.in' in the pinball sources has the line
AC_DEFINE(EM_DEBUG) uncommented.

Cheers, Henrik.

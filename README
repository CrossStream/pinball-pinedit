Installation
============

Ok, this is the first snapshot of the editor. It is a pre-alpha, seg-faulting,
doc-less wretch. But be patient it will get better. Remember that I warned you 
about the seg-faults.

So, you need to have the latest _cvs_ 'pinball' source directory in the same
directory as the 'pinedit' source directory.

I.e.
  home -> mydevdir -> pinball
                   -> pinedit

Then you need to change the EM_QTDIR variable in the 'configure.in' file
in the 'pinedit' directory to point to your qt-3.x.x  develop directory. Do 
a 'bootstrap', a 'configure' and a 'make'. I never do the 'make install', I just run 
the app from the source dir with 'pinedit/pinedit'. (If anyone wants to
fix the qt-thing in 'configure.in', be my guest.)

I recommend that you build the pinball sources as a debug version. The cvs version
is usually debug. Check that the 'configure.in' in the pinball sources has the line
AC_DEFINE(EM_DEBUG) uncommented.

Usage
=====

This is only short introduction how to work the editor.

Start by openening the 'pinball.pbl' file in the 'data' directory.
You can add walls by using the extrude button and draging the walls.
If you want to add a bumper press the 'load group' button and select 
the 'bumper.pbl' file, now a bumper will be merged to your 'pinball.pbl' 
file. There are only a few objects at the moment in the data directory 
to include to your project. 

If you want to add a graphics to the floor first create a png-image
with gimp or something. I recommend to set the size of the picture
to 256x256. Then select the group 'groupfloor' in the in 
the list in the shapes tab at right. Open up the group and select the 
first shape 'shape0'. With the 'shape0' highlighted click on the 'polygons'
tab to go to the polygons view. In the bottom of the polygonsview there
is a tab called 'texture'. Make sure your image is in the same directory
as the pinball.pbl file i.e. 'data'. Choose your image with the 'choose'
button. The texture should now be applied to the floor. If the texture
is not correct then edit the texcoord by selecting _one_ polygon and pressing
'edit texcoords' or by selection _all_ polygons and pressing 'auto texcoords'

To test play your level you have to save in a sub-directory of the 'data' 
directory of the game. You can use the '-data' switch at command line
to specify the data directory of the game. Look at how the 'professor' 
and the 'tux' level are saved and save it the save way. You need to have
the your 'pinball.pbl' file plus graphics files in the same directory 
(you don't need to copy the 'bumper.pbl' file).

Cheers, Henrik.
